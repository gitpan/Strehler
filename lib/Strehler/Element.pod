=head1 DESCRIPTION

Articles, images and every entity you decide to manage in Strehler have to be Strehler::Element subclasses. Strehler::Element is the collection of methods that you can call to (mainly) retrieve the data inserted in the CMS and make it available in your business logic.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Below, a code example to display an archive (with pagination) with all the articles about a certain category.

    get '/romanzo' => sub {
        my $entries_per_page = 20;
        my $page = params->{page} || 1;
        my $order = params->{order} || 'desc';
        my $elements = Strehler::Element::Article->get_list({ 
            page => $page, 
            entries_per_page => $entries_per_page, 
            category => 'EXAMPLE_CATEGORY', 
            language => 'en', 
            ext => 1, 
            published => 1, 
            order => $order});
        template "archive", { 
            page_title => 'Archive',
            articles => $elements->{'to_view'}, 
            page => $page, 
            order => $order, 
            last_page => $elements->{'last_page'} };

    };

=over 4

=item exists

Return Value: $exists

Return 1 if the element is linked to a real row on the database, 0 otherwise.

=item get_attr

Arguments: $attr

Return Value: $attr_value

Return the value for the attribute (the database column) named $attr.

=item get_attr_multilang

=item get_tags

Return Value: $tags

=item get_basic_data

Return Value %data;

Return all the data about the element, except for multilang attributes.

=item get_ext_data

Arguments: $lang

Return Value %data;

=back

=head1 METHODS TO RETRIEVE ELEMENTS

The most important methods. Some of them are class method. They're wrappers for the queries needed to retrieve data.

=over 4

=item get_list

Arguments: \%query_params

Return Values: \%elements

Main class method to retrieve elements. There're many query_params you can use.

    order => desc|asc # The order of the results. Default is desc
    order_by => $order_by # The field to order by. Default is id. 
                          # Accept array_ref for multiple ordering.
    entries_per_page => $entries # How many results retrieve. Default is 20.
                                 # -1 makes the method return ALL results
    page => $page. Default is 1
    language => $lang # The language for multilanguage attributes. 
                      # Default is Strehler configured default language
    published => $pub # Retrive only published elements (for publishable elements)
    tag => $tag # Retrieve elements with a certain tag
    category => $category # Retrieve elements with a certain category
                          # Category can be written in the form $parent/$cat
    category_id => $category_id # Retrieve elements with the category with that id
    ext => 1 # Return elements with al data (get_ext_data is invoked)

order_by attribute can be written as a field of the multilanguage children table. For example articles can be ordered using contents.title. In this case contents table will be filtered on language field, using only the considered language in the query.

All the parameters can be combined togheter.

The method return a pointer to an hash composed by:

    to_view => \@to_view # A pointer to an array of hashes. Every hash contain the data about an element 
                         # as in get_basic_data or get_ext_data
    last_page => last available page, to make easy paging logic.
